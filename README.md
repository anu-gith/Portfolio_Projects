The primary objective of the analysis is to extract insights about the attendance patterns of employees over a period of three months. The main KPIs of this analysis include:
## KPIs
- % of Presence of employees over time
- % of opting Work From Home over time
- % of Sick Leaves among employees over time

## Observations
-The presence % is relatively high showing consistency among employees
-There is a gradual decrease in presence % towards the month of June and an upward trend in the % of sick leaves.  
-The SL % in April is 0.43%, increasing to 1.18% by June.
-This could be due to seasonal factors like weather changes  leading to sickness. 
-There are chances that employees prefer WFH rather than availing full leaves during these situations.

## Suggestions
-Periodic employee wellness checks during flu seasons or epidemics
-Efffecient workload distribution throughout the week.
-A hybrid system where employees can take turns on on-site and WFH duty throughout the week so that office premises can have the optimum use of resources
