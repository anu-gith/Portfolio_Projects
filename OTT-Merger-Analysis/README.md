###🔍 Focus Areas:
##• Subscriber activity, growth, and inactivity patterns and content consumption behaviour
##• Upgrade/downgrade behavior analysis across age, subscription plan & city tiers
##• Content library analysis across languages and genres
##• Watch time distribution by user cohorts

###💡 Key Insights:
