OTT Merger Power BI Dashboard

Explore key performance and behavioural insights for Jotstar and Liocinema (Jan–Nov 2024) to support the upcoming Lio-Jotstar merger. Analyse user growth, content consumption, inactivity, and subscription plan movement, revenue trends across both platforms.

This project involved the entire ETL pipeline:

🔹 Importing data using SQL

🔹 Cleaning and data transformation in Power Query

🔹 Building relationships and measures in Power BI

🔹 Designing an interactive dashboard with key business indicators


🔍 Focus Areas:

• Subscriber activity, growth, and inactivity patterns and content consumption behaviour

• Upgrade/downgrade behavior analysis across age, subscription plan & city tiers

• Content library analysis across languages and genres

• Watch time distribution by user cohorts


💡 Key Insights:

• Jotstar leads in ARPU and Tier 1 urban reach, while Liocinema dominates in Tier 2 with broader user base

• Inactive users are predominantly on free plans, providing an opportunity for targeted reactivation

• Mobile devices record higher content consumption than devices such as Laptops and TVs across both platforms

• Users in the top 10th percentile (especially in Liocinema) drive a significant share of total watch time

• Combining Jotstar's premium content & Liocinema's regional strength could build a market-leading OTT platform
